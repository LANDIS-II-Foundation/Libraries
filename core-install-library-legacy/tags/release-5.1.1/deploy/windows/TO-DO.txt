TO DO

*  Move the info files and the sample input files for the plug-ins into their
   respective projects in the repository (e.g., .../{plug-in}/deploy), so that
   they're consistent with all other plug-ins in the repository.  So when a
   plug-in developer checks out one of these plug-ins, she gets all the
   relevant files: source code, extension info file, documentation, sample
   input files.

   Would need to update the Inno Setup script to refer to the plug-ins'
   working copies to get the info and input files.  Or NAnt should copy the
   files from the working copies to this project (it is a platform-independent
   step).  NAnt could even generate the sample scenario file from a template
   by inserting the names of the sample input files:

     ...

     >> Succession Extension     Initialization File
     >> --------------------     -------------------
        "Age-only Succession"    @AGE_ONLY_SUCC_INPUT@


     >> Disturbance Extensions   Initialization File
     >> ----------------------   -------------------
        "Base Wind"              @BASE_WIND_INPUT@
        "Base Fire"		         @BASE_FIRE_INPUT@

        DisturbancesRandomOrder  yes  << optional parameter; default = no


     >> Other Extensions         Initialization File
     >> ----------------         -------------------
        "Max Species Age"        @MAX_AGE_INPUT@
        Reclass                  @RECLASS_INPUT@

     ...
 
 *  Revise the script to allow a user without administrative rights to install
    LANDIS-II.  The user would be able to select a folder other than the
    hard-wired "C:\Program Files"; for example, for use in a computer lab.
