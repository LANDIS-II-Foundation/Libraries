TO DO

*  Move the RTF source files for the plug-ins into their respective projects
   in the repository (e.g., .../{plug-in}/doc/{title}.rtf) for consistency
   with all other plug-ins in the repository.  So when a plug-in developer
   checks out one of these plug-ins, she gets all the relevant files: source
   code, documentation, sample input files.

*  Move document sources to a format that can easily be edited with free tools
   *and* can be used to generate different output formats (e.g., PDFs, HTML,
   etc) automatically.  DocBook?  AsciiDoc?
